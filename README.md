# EDA-Lending-Prediction

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Lending Prediction dataset. The objective is to explore and analyze the dataset to understand the patterns of good and bad loan applicants using various data analysis techniques.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter notebook with the EDA.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is `final_project_lending.csv`, which contains information about credit applicants. The target variable is `bad_loan`, where 1 indicates a default (loan not paid on time) and 0 indicates a non-default (loan paid on time).

## Notebook

The Jupyter notebook `Lending_Prediction_EDA.ipynb` contains the following sections:

1. **Details on the dataset**: Overview of the dataset, target variable, and characteristics of applicants.
2. **Data Visualization**: Visual exploration of data distributions and relationships.
3. **Descriptive Statistics**: Statistical summary of the dataset.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyzing relationships between variables.
5. **Handling Outliers**:  Identifying and treating outliers.
6. **Missing Values and Anomalies**: Addressing missing values and anomalies.
7. **Feature Selection**: Selecting relevant features for modeling.
8. **Pipelines Creation**: Building data processing pipelines.
9. **Create pipelines with transformers**: Implementing transformers for preprocessing tasks.
